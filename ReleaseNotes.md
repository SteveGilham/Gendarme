# 2020.2.xx.xxx-pre-release

For previous releases, go here -- https://github.com/SteveGilham/Gendarme/blob/master/ReleaseNotes%20-%20Previously.md
Since this is a release from a fork, [issues should be reported at my related repo](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcode.fake/issues) that contains a Fake driver for the Gendarme tool, but noted as being against the forked Gendarme tool itself.
