# 2020.3.xx.xxxxx-pre-release

* [BUGFIX] The extension method `IsEventCallback` would throw NRE for certain generic F# types
* For `AvoidLargeClassesRule`, ignore `FSharpFunc` and `FSharpTypeFunc` valued fields in generated types with `@` in their names; treat them as methods in the type instead.
* For `AvoidDeepNamespaceHierarchyRule`, ignore F# generated namespaces of the form `<StartupCode$a-b-c-d>.$.NETFramework,Version=...`
* For `AvoidRepetitiveCastsRule`, ignore F# `is` then `as` of temporaries (often happens in `match` expressions on sum types)
* Building on VS2019 for .net4.0 and .netcore2.1+
* Now available as a dotnet global tool in package `altcode.gendarme.global`

Since this is a release from a fork, [issues should be reported at my related repo](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcode.fake/issues) that contains a Fake driver for the Gendarme tool, but noted as being against the forked Gendarme tool itself.
